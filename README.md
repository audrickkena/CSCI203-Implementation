# CSCI203-Implementation
This repo is for implementing data structures and algorithms discussed in CSCI203 - Algorithms and Data Structures taught by the University of Wollongong.


Implementation will be done only using arrays and the basic data types. Compilation instructions will be inside each folder for each language.
